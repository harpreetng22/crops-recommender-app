Abstract
Data mining is the practice of examining and deriving purposeful information from the data. Data mining finds its application in various fields like finance, retail, medicine, agriculture etc. Data mining in agriculture is used for analyzing the various biotic and abiotic factors. Agriculture in India plays a predominant role in economy and employment. The common problem existing among the Indian farmers are they don't choose the right crop based on their soil requirements. Due to this they face a serious setback in productivity. This problem of the farmers has been addressed through precision agriculture. Precision agriculture is a modern farming technique that uses research data of soil characteristics, soil types, crop yield data collection and suggests the farmers the right crop based on their site-specific parameters. This reduces the wrong choice on a crop and increase in productivity. In this paper, this problem is solved by proposing a recommendation system through an ensemble model with majority voting technique using Random tree, CHAID, K-Nearest Neighbor and Naive Bayes as learners to recommend a crop for the site specific parameters with high accuracy and efficiency.
